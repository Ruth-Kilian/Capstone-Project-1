                        <h2>Chef Gordan Ramsay</h2>
                            <div class = "row p-3">
                                <p>
                                    Gordon Ramsay started working in kitchens in the mid-1980s when he was a teenager. He got a job in the kitchen of Harvey's restaurant in London, which was then run by a brilliant, charismatic and famously hot-tempered chef named Marco Pierre White.
                                    Ramsay credits White as being one of the people who inspired him to have the highest standards in cooking, and to work as hard as possible.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In 1993, Ramsay opened his first restaurant as chef, with assistance from White; "Aubergine" got its first Michelin star fourteen months later. In 1998, his Restaurant Gordon Ramsay was opened and in 2001 it achieved three Michelin stars; the highest amount possible.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He is a master of the basics. Very few chefs can step back onto prep and do it well. He has taught other Michelin starred chefs their trade. He knows how to work hard and he treats those around him with the respect they deserve. He is a patient mentor, but an impatient non-sufferer of fools.

He got his love of food and early cooking lessons from his mom. "She taught me about seasonal cooking. And also, how to keep things simple. Fusion is all very well but so often, what you end up with is confusion." Coco believes a true passion for cooking comes from within, but to be a great chef takes practice
